marekHoraczyInfo.jsf=Marek Horaczy information site
start.jsf=Hi there! <br />\n My name is Marek  Horaczy. I am a passionate java programmer who creates this page to highlight my person  to potential new employer. <br /> \n From a technical point of view, this site is built in Java Server Faces framework with Prime Faces GUI.</br> Hosting is provided by https://www.openshift.com. <br />\n Feel free to browse detailed information about me, brief descriptions of the projects I worked / works or  see other applications that i create  in my  spare time, including this site source code.
startH.jsf=About that site
uzH.jsf=University of Zielona G\u00f3ra
uzInfo1.jsf=I graduated university studies at the faculty of mathematics computer science and econometrics in Zielona G\u00f3ra.<br/>
uzInfo2.jsf=Time of of studies could be summarized  with one of mu old notes.
uzInfo3.jsf=Although most of the course were linked directly with mathematics and subjects related to it, there  appeared a few course related to programming and databases. Even though there were not many of them, they injected in me a fascination of  programming that i am trying to develop when i have a chance.
work1.jsf=After graduation, I was able to get to the local company " Max Elektronik " for practice , where i still works anyway. I joined to the team of experts, where i received  various tasks in first 3 months associated closely to java programing. Starting with testing of server-side methods using JUnit ,next rewriting the older part of the project from the language C ++ to java, finally writing services in spring framework which also later i have to test through applications SoapUI. My boss after seeing my involvement decided to assign me to 'rescue team' which had to support the project from Warsaw remotely, based on SmartGWT, hibernate and spring. In it, I spent a very productive  whole year of  programming.\n
workH.jsf=The beginning of the the work at Max Elektronik and projects in Java
sasH.jsf=New project, SAS platform and data warehouse
sas1.jsf=After a successful "rescue" STAY project, I was accepted into the company's for good.I received an contract for an indefinite period, and the status of proven employee. It so happened that temporary  there was no  Java projects and the newly opened company cell for data warehouse needed a fresh people for the one of the  most biggest projects which our company has had the opportunity to do. In this way, I started to work in project based on the SAS platform. To which I belong and where I work at the moment.
projectsH.jsf=Projects
plid1.jsf=PL.ID is a project associated with the new electronic identity cards and modernization of the existing PESEL registry.\nMore information about system can be found at:\nhttp://obywatel.gov.pl/main.</br>\n<a href="http://obywatel.gov.pl/main">The government's information page of PL.ID</a>
plid2.jsf=In this project, I worked about two months. Get a lot of minor tasks to settle into the company. The first tasks that have been assigned to me included:\n<ul>\n<li>\nCovering with unit tests methods of the classes created by my older friends. I have used plugin in eclipse to find the areas that were not tested, and I created newly one testing methods with JUnit  framework .\n</ li>\n<li>\nTesting of webservices  in accordance with the standards of the project and xml schemes. For this type of testing i used the application called SoapUI.\n</ li>\n<li>\nAfter getting used to the project by testing I received more and more tasks, reaching the point where accordance with relevant standards, schemes and documentation i used to implement by myself important spring web-services.  For example i implemented  the service which was registering information on newborn  member of Poland society. From a technical point of view, it was a simply  method in spring bean  marked with appropriate annotations and later exposed as webservice to which our external applications called back.\n</ li>\n<li>\nIn addition, I also 'had the pleasure' to rewrite parts of the old Database Management System based Jantar C ++ into Java, which was used further through our internal applications.\n</ li>\n<ul>
pobyt1.jsf=The Pobyt system stores foreigner's personal data and data on the administrative procedure,\nincluding the following variables:  </br> date of birth, country of birth, citizenship, marital\nstatus, date of application and decision, type of decision. </br>  Pobyt system is currently\nthe most reliable source of information on the stock of temporary migrants in\nPoland.</br>System also is connected indirectly to the "Visa Information System" and "Schengen Information System" which exchanges data about the foreigners\n
pobyt2.jsf=It was my first big and professional project in which i had a chance to show myself as a developer. I was assigned with few senior java developers as a \u201crescue team\u201d. At the beginning of deployment into the \u201cPobyt\u201d I was assigned as a helper for my older friends, however after few months  i was a independent developer who got hardest tasks. </br>\nMy main responsibilities in project included:\n<ul>\n<li>Creating main forms of application GUI.</br>It was strictly linked with documentation that I was given by our projects analysts. Basing on theirs point of view and using very rich SmartGWT \n<a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#main"> library</a>  I tried to design expected view. I used all kinds of components, layouts, mixed them in group, linked them, modificate to achieve goal.</li></br>\n<li>Creating  controller mechanism. </br>After preparing "soulless" GUI I had to make it live with suitable way, identified by specific area of documentation. \nIn smartGWT the thing was mainly provided by so called values manager mechanism. \nIt was used to manages data from multiple member forms, which was later send for spring controlling beans,services where businesses logic happened. \nThose beans where annotated  as a regular spring services, also they were linked with hibernate classes, which we used to persist data at database. Just like in common Model(hibernate) View(smartGWT) Controller( part of smartGWT and Spring).\n</li></br>\n<li>Introducing new developer to with project structure and smartGWT mechanism.</br> \nAfter last few months project manager assigned me new developer, I guided him through basics of work, checked his code eventually fixed things if something goes wrong.</li></br>\n</ul>
p11.jsf=eHealth:\nrefers to tools and services using information and communication technologies (ICTs) that can improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and management.\ncan benefit the entire community by improving access to care and quality of care and by making the health sector more efficient.\nincludes information and data sharing between patients and health service providers, hospitals, health professionals and health information networks;\nelectronic health records; telemedicine services; portable patient-monitoring devices, operating room scheduling software, robotized surgery and blue-sky research on the virtual physiological human.\nThere is even commercial made by government  Istnieje nawet reklama projektu<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfA_aVPjobg"> to watch on youtube</a>\n<ul>\nIt`s very large project with many modules. \nMy team part is to create well performing system of reporting based on huge data sets. \nWe are implementing it via SAS platform.</br>\nMy part of jobs in that project were linked chronologically were:</br>\n\n<li>\nCreating of executive project of our database structures based on UML.\nIt was related with that we didn't have ready database and data, information about them had to be collected by our team and analyst and written as UML objects. Main application that we used for it was <b>Enterprise Architect</b>\n</li></br>\n\n<li>\nAfter creating draft of our database structures we had to adapt and learn our main tools of work. We had to set up SAS development SAS environment and install main part of it.\n</li></br>\n\n<li>\nNext and the main part of my work which last in some part for today is creating OLAP cubes.  Based on database tables we connect them in olap cube structures and supply them with some test data to create interactive rapports.\nIn that case I use tools like:</br></br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>SAS Data Integration</b> To create SAS libraries used for overall work\n</li></br>\n<li>\n<b>SAS Management Console</b> To administrate some olap related servers and manage files structures\n</li></br>\n<li>\n<b>SAS Guide</b> To create advanced raports based on <b>SAS Macro Language/SAS Base programming language</b>, build/modify olap cubes with more advanced solution. And a lot of more. SAS Guide is really versatile tool.\n</li></br>\n\n<li>\n<b>SAS Olap Cube Studio</b>  To create and manage OLAP cubes.\n</li></br>\n\n<li>\n<b>SAS Olap Map information studio and SAS Web Raport Studio</b> To create Information maps and use them as some kind of source data for interactive rapports made in Web Report Studio.\n</li></br>\n</ul>\n</li></br>\n<li>\nNow days as one of the most experienced developers in project,\nmy everyday tasks are related with helping new team mates and lead them eventual when they a problem.\nAnother important things is a control of knowledge flow between developers team and analyst team that presents client directly.\n</li></br>\n\n<li>\nAs a additional information I could add my personal achievement.\nAs a team with more then 10 developers was chosen \nto lead an installation(with good friend who took technical part of it)and support\nof testing part of our project in client place. Did work hard almost for week in Warsaw, but as a team we made job done.\n</li></br>\n\n</ul>
certM.jsf=Certificates
cert1.jsf=By the time of working in Sygnity I did participate in few courses which ended in certification:</br>\nEJB training:\nThe course last 2 days. It was a carried out by professional oracle instructor. \nDuring the course instructor presented us at the basics of EJB\nthat we used to create a simple application  with\nJava Message Service. \nThe EJB container exposed bean that\nhandle external requests and returned the current date as a JMS response.\nSAS Training: </ br>\nThat was training related with my project moving into the SAS platform. \nEach of the training lasted 2-3 days, took place in the center of the SAS in Warsaw.\nWe received solid base and we learned the main tools that we use at the moment.\n\n
codeM.jsf=My site
codeMySite1.jsf=My site was created mainly because my recent project in SAS platform dont let me learn new thing related to Java and web technologies.</br>\nI became interested in the JSF framework because I wanted to quickly and efficiently build web applications using Java language.</br>\nI do not conceal that primefaces libraries very affected the direction of my learning.</br>\nf course, please be aware that this is a work of pure hobby, and unfortunately there is only Polish version</br>\nThe source code of the application are available for viewing at:</br>
codeC.jsf=Car shop
codeC1.jsf=The "Car shop" is a project that I was doing as an help for friend.</br>\nThe intentions was to build a simple CRUD plication that allowed to carry out operations on cars, simulating the registry in car workshop.</br>\nTaking into account acceptance of cars by employees who estimate of repair cost register theirs work. The hours of their work is registered by system and sum.</br>\nTechnologies used to make that project were SWING and JDBC.</br>\nSorce code of application:</br>
