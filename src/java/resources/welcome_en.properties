marekHoraczyInfo.jsf=Marek Horaczy information site
start.jsf=Hi there! <br />\n My name is Marek  Horaczy. I am a passionate java programmer who creates this page to highlight my person  to potential new employer. <br /> \n From a technical point of view, this site is built by Java Server Faces framework with Prime Faces GUI. Hosting is provided by https://www.openshift.com. <br />\n Feel free to browse detailed information about me, brief descriptions of the projects I worked / works or  see other applications that i create  in my  spare time.
startH.jsf=About that site
uzH.jsf=University of Zielona G\u00f3ra
uzInfo1.jsf=I graduated university studies at the faculty of mathematics computer science and econometrics in Zielona G\u00f3ra.<br/>
uzInfo2.jsf=Time of of studies could be summarized  with one of mu old notes.
uzInfo3.jsf=Although most of the course were linked directly with mathematics and subjects related to it, there  appeared a few course related to programming and databases. Even though there were not many of them, they injected in me a fascination of  programming that i  determinedly trying to develop when i have a chance.
work1.jsf=After graduation, I was able to get to the local company " Max Elektronik " for practice , where i still works anyway. I joined to the team of experts, where i received  various tasks in first 3 months associated closely to java programing. Starting with unit testing server-side methods using JUnit ,next rewriting the older part of the project from the language C ++ to java, reaching writing services in spring framework which also later i have to test through applications SoapUI. My boss after seeing my involvement decided to assign me to 'rescue team' which had to support the project from warsaw remotly, based on SmartGWT, hibernate and spring. In it, I spent a very productive  whole year of  programming.\n
workH.jsf=The beginning of the the work at Max Elektronik and projects in Java
sasH.jsf=New project, SAS platform and data warehouse
sas1.jsf=After a successful "rescue" STAY project, I was accepted into the company's sta\u0142e.I recived an contract for an indefinite period, and the status of proven employee. It so happened that temporary  there was no  Java projects and the newly opened company cell for data warehouse needed a fresh people for the one of the  most biggest projects which our company has had the opportunity to do. In this way, I started to work ine  the project based on the SAS platform. To which I belong and where I work at the moment.

plid1.jsf=PL.ID is a project associated with the new electronic identity cards and modernization of the existing PESEL registry.\nMore information about system can be found at:\nhttp://obywatel.gov.pl/main.</br>\n<a href="http://obywatel.gov.pl/main">The government's information page of PL.ID</a>
plid2.jsf=In this project, I worked about two months. Get a lot of minor tasks to settle into the company. The first tasks that have been assigned to me included:\n<ul>\n<li>\nCovering with unit tests methods of the classes created by my older friends. I have used  plugin in eclipse to find the areas that were not tested, and I created newly one testing methods with JUnit  framework .\n</ li>\n<li>\nTesting of webservices  in accordance with the standards of the project and xml schemas. For this type of testing i used the application called SoapUI.\n</ li>\n<li>\nAfter getting used to the project by testing I received new and new task, reaching the point where accordance with relevant standards, schemes and documentation i used to implement by myself importatnt spring web-services.  For example i implemented  the service which  was registering information on newborn  member of Poland society. From a technical point of view, it was a simply  method in spring bean  marked with appropriate annotations and later exposed as webservcie to which our external applications called back.\n</ li>\n<li>\nIn addition, I also had the pleasure to rewrite parts of the old Database Management System based Jantar C ++ into Java, which was used further through our internal applications.\n</ li>\n<ul>
pobyt1.jsf=The Pobyt system stores foreigners\u2019 personal data and data on the administrative procedure,\nincluding the following variables:  </br> date of birth, country of birth, citizenship, marital\nstatus, date of application and decision, type of decision. </br>  Pobyt system is currently\nthe most reliable source of information on the stock of temporary migrants in\nPoland.</br>System also is connected indirectly to the "Visa Information System" and "Schengen Information System" which exchanges data about the foreigners\n
pobyt2.jsf=It was my first big and professional project in which i had a chance to show myself as a developer. I was assigned with few senior java developers as a \u201crescue team\u201d. At the beginning of deployment into the \u201cPobyt\u201d I was assigned as a helper for my older friends, however after few months  i was a independent developer who got hardest tasks. </br>\nMy main responsibilities in project included:\n<ul>\n<li>Creating main forms of application GUI.</br>It was strictly linked with documentation that I was given by our projects analysts. Basing on theirs point of view and using very rich SmartGWT \n<a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/#main"> library</a>  I tried to design expected view. I used all kinds of components, layouts, mixed them in group, linked them, modificate to achieve goal.</li>\n<li>Creating  controller mechanism. </br>After preparing "soulless" GUI I had to make it live with suitable way, identified by specific area of documentation. \nIn smartGWT the thing was mainly provided by so called values manager mechanism. \nIt was used to manages data from multiple member forms, which was later send for spring controlling beans,services where businesses logic happened. \nThose beans where annotated  as a regular spring services, also they were linked with hibernate classes, which we used to persist data at database. Just like in common Model(hibernate) View(smartGWT) Controller( part of smartGWT and Spring).\n</li>\n<li>Introducing new developer to with project structure and smartGWT mechanism.</br> \nAfter last few months project manager assigned me new developer, I guided him through basics of work, checked his code eventually fixed things if something goes wrong.</li>\n</ul>
