startH.jsf=About that site
uzH.jsf=University of Zielona G\u00f3ra
uzInfo1.jsf=I graduated university studies at the faculty of mathematics computer science and econometrics in Zielona G\u00f3ra.<br/>
uzInfo2.jsf=Time of of studies could be summarized  with one of mu old notes.
uzInfo3.jsf=Although most of the course were linked directly with mathematics and subjects related to it, there  appeared a few course related to programming and databases. Even though there were not many of them, they injected in me a fascination of  programming that i  determinedly trying to develop when i have a chance.
work1.jsf=After graduation, I was able to get to the local company " Max Elektronik " for practice , where i still works anyway. I joined to the team of experts, where i received  various tasks in first 3 months associated closely to java programing. Starting with unit testing server-side methods using JUnit ,next rewriting the older part of the project from the language C ++ to java, reaching writing services in spring framework which also later i have to test through applications SoapUI. My boss after seeing my involvement decided to assign me to 'rescue team' which had to support the project from warsaw remotly, based on SmartGWT, hibernate and spring. In it, I spent a very productive  whole year of  programming.\n
workH.jsf=The beginning of the the work at Max Elektronik and projects in Java
sasH.jsf=New project, SAS platform and data warehouse
sas1.jsf=After a successful "rescue" STAY project, I was accepted into the company's sta\u0142e.I recived an contract for an indefinite period, and the status of proven employee. It so happened that temporary  there was no  Java projects and the newly opened company cell for data warehouse needed a fresh people for the one of the  most biggest projects which our company has had the opportunity to do. In this way, I started to work ine  the project based on the SAS platform. To which I belong and where I work at the moment.
